# BiCGSTAB-Julia

An effective implementation of BiCGStab - procedure for solving large, sparse linear systems - in Julia programming language is introduced. Performance has been measured on symmetric and nonsymmetric problems which arise from solutions of partial differential equations. The aim of the paper is to show the results, observations, key aspects and improvements. Both preconditioned and non-preconditioned variants are considered
